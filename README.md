# 💻 .dotfiles - a repository

While this repository is public, the configurations are mostly for personal use. Nothing here is super `secret`, so feel free to pick up what you like and use it for your own configurations or even let it act as inspiration. The current setup is prepared for `macOS`, but most configurations are os independent.

## Todo:

- [ ] Write documentation on how to install
- [ ] Add fancy configurations
- [x] Add initial configurations
- [x] Create the repository
